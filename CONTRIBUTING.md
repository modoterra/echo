# Contributing to Echo

Thanks for your interest in Echo. This document covers legal requirements and
the practical workflow for contributions.

## License and ownership

Echo is released under the **MIT License**. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Copyright in the project is held by **Modoterra Corporation**. Contributions
are governed by the **Echo Contributor License Agreement** ([`CLA.md`](CLA.md)),
which **assigns all copyright and intellectual property** in your contribution
to Modoterra Corporation.

**By submitting a contribution** (pull request, commit, patch, or other material
intended for inclusion), you accept the CLA. No separate signature or PR
statement is required. If you do not agree, do not contribute.

If you contribute on behalf of an employer or company, you must have authority
to bind that entity; your submission is that entity’s acceptance for those
contributions.

We cannot accept contributions that are not original to you (or your entity)
unless third-party material is clearly identified and under compatible terms,
as described in the CLA.

## Before you start

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for product invariants and proof requirements.
   Which test to write: [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).
2. Skim [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and the relevant layer
   docs under [`docs/`](docs/).
3. Prefer small, reviewable changes that land as full vertical slices when the
   change is language-facing (syntax → parse → semantics → IR → codegen →
   runtime → proofs → docs, as applicable).

## Development setup

Requirements and the local edit/test loop are documented in
[`docs/development-speed.md`](docs/development-speed.md).

After clone, install Git hooks so commits that touch Rust fail on **errors or
warnings**:

```bash
scripts/install-hooks.sh
# or: just hooks
```

Useful commands:

```bash
cargo build -p xo
cargo test -p <crate>
just check-deny          # same as pre-commit: workspace check, -Dwarnings
scripts/gate changed
scripts/gate echo26    # language / runtime surface changes
scripts/gate workspace # broad check
```

## Pull requests

- Keep the PR focused on one concern.
- Update **crate tests**, **Echo 2026** fixtures (`echo26/` / `e26`), and
  **examples** when your change affects those surfaces (see `AGENTS.md`).
- Update the matching docs under `docs/` (and `www/` when user-facing Spec or
  Reference text changes).
- Do not reintroduce PHP compatibility goals.
- Do not invent language edge cases without authority in the public Spec,
  implementer docs, an ADR, or an explicit maintainer decision recorded in-tree.

### PR checklist

- [ ] Focused tests added or updated where behavior changed
- [ ] `scripts/gate changed` (or relevant crate / echo26 / std-test / examples gates) pass locally
- [ ] Docs updated when durable facts or user-visible rules changed
- [ ] No unrelated refactors mixed into the same PR

## Reporting issues

Use GitHub issues for bugs and concrete proposals. Include:

- what you expected;
- what happened;
- `xo` / commit version if relevant;
- a minimal reproduction when possible.

Maintainers may refuse or revert contributions that violate the CLA or project
standards.

## Security

Report vulnerabilities privately per [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
([security@modoterra.xyz](mailto:security@modoterra.xyz)). Do not open public
issues for security reports.

## Questions

For design discussion, prefer issues or discussions that can be linked from
commits and ADRs. Durable decisions belong in `docs/` and `docs/adr/`, not only
in chat.
