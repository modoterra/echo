# Architecture decision records

Durable decisions for Echo. Each ADR records **context**, **decision**, and
**consequences**. Prefer short ADRs over essays.

Language **surface** decisions are intentionally sparse after the design reset.
Prefer writing evolving rules in `docs/syntax.md` / `docs/lexer.md` until a
choice must stick forever—then add an ADR.

## When to write an ADR

- The choice is hard to reverse or expensive to re-argue.
- Two reasonable alternatives existed and one was selected.
- A product or architecture boundary must stay stable across many PRs.

Do **not** ADR routine syntax experiments while still exploring. Put those in
`syntax.md` and the roadmap session log first.
